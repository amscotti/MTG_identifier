- Copy and configure the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Open `.env` and insert your Gemini API key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))

#### Step 4: Place Images

- Move your MTG card images into the `Unidentified` folder.

#### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

### Option 2: Using DevContainer (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Code with [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
- Docker Desktop installed and running
